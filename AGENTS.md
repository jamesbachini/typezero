# Agent Rules (TypeZERO)

- Source of truth is `docs/spec.md`.
- No hidden secrets for security; everything must be auditable.
- All encoding must be deterministic and documented (see `shared/` and `docs/spec.md`).
- Always run tests/commands before finishing each task.
- Keep version pins exact as specified.
- Prefer simple, buildable placeholders over incomplete features.
