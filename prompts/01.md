## Task 1/5 — Scaffold repo + pin deps + AGENTS.md + dev scripts (Stellar TESTNET)

**You are Codex. Implement this task fully before moving on. Run commands and fix errors.**

### Goal

Create a working monorepo skeleton for the “ZK-Verified Typing Challenge” (see `docs/spec.md`). Pin all versions. Add a clean dev workflow.

### Repo structure (create these)

* `docs/spec.md` — paste the full spec from the prior message (source of truth)
* `AGENTS.md` — short rules + pointers to `docs/spec.md`
* `contracts/leaderboard/` — Soroban contract crate
* `risc0/typing_proof/methods/guest/` — RiscZero guest
* `risc0/typing_proof/host/` — RiscZero host prover
* `backend/` — HTTP API server (Rust or Node; pick simplest)
* `frontend/` — web app

### Pin versions exactly

**contracts/leaderboard/Cargo.toml** must contain:

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "25.0.2"
sep-41-token = "1.4.0"
soroban-fixed-point-math = "1.5.0"
blend-contract-sdk = "2.25.0"
stellar-tokens = "0.6.0"
stellar-access = "0.6.0"
stellar-contract-utils = "0.6.0"
stellar-macros = "0.6.0"
stellar-accounts = "0.6.0"
```

**frontend/package.json** must pin:

* `@stellar/stellar-sdk` **14.5.0**

### Shared deterministic rules

Create `shared/` (or `packages/shared/`) and put:

* `shared/replay.ts` (or equivalent) — canonical event encoding & key map
* `shared/rules.md` — prompt normalization and scoring constants
  You can duplicate in Rust later, but define the single authoritative mapping here.

### Stellar TESTNET config

Add `.env.example` (NO secrets):

* `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet`
* `HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
* `SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` (or correct testnet RPC if different)
* placeholder contract IDs
  Document these in README.

### Tooling / scripts

Add a root `Makefile` (or npm scripts) with:

* `make test` → runs:

  * `cargo test` for each Rust crate
  * `npm test` for frontend
* `make fmt` / `make lint` where feasible
* `make dev` → runs backend + frontend (concurrently if possible)

### AGENTS.md requirements

Must include:

* “Source of truth is `docs/spec.md`”
* “No hidden secrets for security”
* “All encoding must be deterministic and documented”
* “Always run tests/commands before finishing each task”

### Minimal buildable placeholders

Each subproject must compile/run minimally:

* contract crate compiles
* risc0 host/guest compile (even if empty main)
* backend runs “hello”
* frontend runs basic page

### Commands you MUST run and make pass

* `cargo test` in:

  * `contracts/leaderboard`
  * `risc0/typing_proof/host`
  * `risc0/typing_proof/methods/guest` (or workspace-level)
* `npm install` + `npm test` in `frontend` (set up minimal test runner)
* `make test` at repo root

### Output

At end, print:

* the exact commands to start dev: backend + frontend
* the exact commands to run tests
