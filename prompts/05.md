## Task 5/5 — Frontend typing game + submit flow to Soroban (testnet) + player name + leaderboard UI + e2e script

**You are Codex. Implement this task fully before moving on. Run e2e and fix issues.**

### Goal

Browser UI that:

* creates/funds a wallet automatically via backend
* runs typing challenge, records replay, computes preview stats
* if user score is high (or always), prompts for name
* calls backend `/prove`
* submits `submit_score` Soroban tx on **Stellar testnet**
* shows leaderboard with names

### Frontend pages/components (minimum)

* Wallet panel:

  * “Create & fund wallet”
  * show public key + XLM balance
* Challenge panel:

  * fetch `GET /challenge/current`
  * show prompt
  * record keystrokes + `dt_ms` between events
* Submit panel:

  * name input (1..24)
  * “Generate proof + Submit”
  * progress UI
* Leaderboard:

  * calls contract `get_top(current_challenge_id)`
  * displays rank, name, score, wpm, accuracy

### Stellar interaction requirements

* Use `@stellar/stellar-sdk@14.5.0`
* Use testnet RPC/Horizon
* Build and submit Soroban tx calling `submit_score`
* Use stored secretKey to sign
* Ensure `player` arg equals invoker and matches wallet pubkey

### Verifier integration constraint (must handle explicitly)

Your contract currently stubs proof verification (Task 2). In this task:

* Keep running on **testnet**.
* Do NOT attempt to deploy Nethermind bn254 verifier unless testnet supports required functions.
* Still store proof artifacts and pass them to `submit_score` as args.
* Add a prominent README note: “Proof verification is stubbed on testnet; swap to real verifier on futurenet when bn254 is available.” (or, if testnet does support it now, replace stub with real call and document exactly how to deploy verifier contract.)

### Frontend tests

* unit tests for:

  * replay encoding matches shared spec
  * timing capture produces expected dt list
* Add a Node e2e script `scripts/e2e-smoke.mjs` that:

  1. calls backend `/wallet`
  2. calls backend `/challenge/current`
  3. uses a fixture replay to call `/prove`
  4. submits `submit_score`
  5. reads `get_top` and asserts the name appears

### Commands you MUST run

* `npm test` in frontend
* run e2e script end-to-end (against local backend + deployed contract)
* run `make test` at root

### Output

Update README with:

* “one-command local dev”
* “deploy contract to testnet”
* “run e2e smoke test”
